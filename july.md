# Transitioning to UIUC

## Move-in tips

- travel light when you move in to your dorm in August
- start planning the things you need to purchase NOW
    - make a packing checklist and update it frequently
    - research dorm move-in process for your specific dorm
    - schedule your move-in date and time
    - pack masks! and other items needed for social distancing!
- stay organized throughout this process!  Campus gets really busy for the first week of classes, and Walmart is pretty much emptied out at this point...
- Coordinate with your roommate on buying shared items

Keep all of these resources bookmarked as you access them!

# Expectations

## Communication

Slack, FB Messenger, etc.?

These meetings are meant to be informal, and my overall goal is to first **and foremost** receive feedback and input from you, and give guidance or tools as necessary.  That being said...

This table will also change over time.

Though this first meeting has both of you guys, from here on out, if you guys prefer it, I will be meeting each of you separately.
